The Class should be changed only for one reason .i.e it should be doing
only one operation. For Example a User Creation should just be used for
Creating user. Validation and Storage can be moved on to other classes
and Proxy to those classes can be used in User object so that It won't change
even if implementation of storage or validation changes
